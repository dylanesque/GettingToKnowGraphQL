# GraphQL-Notes

## Intro/Who Am I

Thanks for coming! Tonight, I'm going to give you a high-level introduction to GraphQL, why it was created, what it excels at, and when it's less useful. My name is Michael Caveney, I'm a self-taught developer that works mostly with JavaScript. I've found the "why" of technology missing in a lot of tutorials, lectures, and books, and I'm going to be deeply focused on that tonight. But before we can talk about GraphQL, we need to understand what came before it.
