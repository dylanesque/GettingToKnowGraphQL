# GraphQL-Notes

## Intro/Who Am I

Thanks for coming! Tonight, I'm going to give you a high-level introduction to GraphQL, why it was created, what it excels at, and when it's less useful. My name is Michael Caveney, I'm a self-taught developer, and I work mostly with JavaScript and Rails. I've found the "why" of technology missing in a lot of tutorials, lectures, and books, and I'm going to be deeply focused on that tonight. But before we can talk about GraphQL, we need to understand what came before it.

## What is GraphQL?

+ RESTful APIs, and their shortcomings (multiple endpoints, overfetching data)
+ The Birth of GraphQL (developed internally at Facebook and used in 2012, driven by the rise of mobile technology, made public in 2015)
+ What problems does this solve? (single endpoint, client dictates what data they want, potentially much less data use than REST)

## The spec basics

  + Type definition language (similar to Mongoose or TypeScript)

  + GraphQL Types
    + Objects
    + Scalar: Int, Float, String, Boolean, ID (Custom scalar types can be created)
    + Enums
    + Interfaces (ala TypeScript)
  
  + Queries
  + Mutations
  + Subscriptions
  + Graphcool/GraphQL playground provides a place to test and experiment with operations right up front.

## Tools and Implementation

+ Apollo (For JavaScript, also provides state management and many other features)
+ Prisma
